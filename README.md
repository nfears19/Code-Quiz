# Code Quiz
# Description
This repository contains my timed coding quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores. This project was a homework assignment from the Case Western Reserve Univeristy's Coding Bootcamp. The assignment is to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that I write. It will have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface.
